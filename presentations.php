				<p>I love giving talks about programming, startups, professional carreer and technology in general and I feel comfortable speaking in either Spanish or English</p>
				<p>I have also given workshops about mobile development, ruby, ruby on rails and javascript. Those workshops lasted an average of three hours and I always try to make them as engaging as possible.</p>
				<p>
